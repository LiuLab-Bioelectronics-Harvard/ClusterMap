### A h5ad file for STARmap placenta dataset can be accessed at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DDCowUuZ7PPFUSZsjvSqntWkYJMjf1Na/view?usp=sharing).

**Note:**

- A cell x gene matrix with normalized gene expression of each cell (e.g. CPM) can be found at `adata.uns['cpm']`. 

  

- The meta information for each cell can be found at `adata.obs`, where `Spot_location_x`, `Spot_location_y` for spatial coordinates, `louvain` for cell type annotation, and `tissue_id` for tissue region annotation.
